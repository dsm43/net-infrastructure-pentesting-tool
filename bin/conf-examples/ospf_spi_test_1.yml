# NOTES:
# - Single Path Injection only works on transmission links where there is a single path between routers
# - router_id and ls_id are ignored and replaced in the script with the springboard ip and id
# - this test is meant to test network partitioning by attacking a single point of failure
# - the springboard router is not considered the DR
