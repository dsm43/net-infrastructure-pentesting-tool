# NOTES:
# - Single Path Injection only works on transmission links where there is a single path between routers
# - router_id and ls_id are replaced in the script with the springboard ip and id
# - this test is meant to test network partitioning by attacking a single point of failure
# - the springboard router is, in this case, considered the DR
# - the injected lsa is a network lsa which disconnects the polluted router from the network by not listing it in the lsa
# - R1 is polluted, R2 is springboard
