## Introduction

The repository contains code for a Python tool to test attacks against the network infrastructure. Utilizing Scapy, the tool provides a user-friendly interface to launch attacks against machines running certain protocols in the attached networks.

A [Docker version](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dsm43/network-testing-tool) is also available.

## Executing the program

The code's functionality and performance was only tested in a Docker environment. No tests were run to ensure the program works in a Windows environment.

When launching from the Docker container, open a console on the container and run the program with the following command:
> python3 bin/main.py
